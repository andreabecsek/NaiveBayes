# Gaussian Naive Bayes

This is an example package created for the Statistical Computing 1 module. The package fits a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to a given dataset and output vector. Moreover, it makes predictions based on the fitted model and test labels.

The main assumption that Naive Bayes makes is that every feature is conditionally independent given the class labels. The reason why this classifier is called naive is that very often this assumption is not actually realistic.
